<div class="hrchapter"><hr /></div>


<p>The Resident Physician, who shall also be the Superintendent,
shall be the chief executive officer of the Asylum;
he shall have the general superintendence of the buildings,
grounds, and property, subject to the laws and regulations
of the Trustees; he shall have the sole control and management
of the patients; he shall ascertain their condition,
daily prescribe their treatment, and adopt such sanitary
measures as he may think best; he shall appoint, with the
approval of the Trustees, so many attendants and assistants
as he may think proper and necessary for the economical
and efficient performance of the business of the Asylum,
prescribe their several duties and places;&mdash;he
shall, also, from time to time, give such orders and instructions
as he may judge best calculated to insure good conduct,
fidelity and economy in every department of labor
and expense; and he is authorized and enjoined to maintain
salutary discipline among all who are employed by
the Institution, and uniform obedience to all the rules and
regulations of the Asylum.&mdash;[<i>State Law of 1858.</i></p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span><a name="ASSISTANT_PHYSICIAN" id="ASSISTANT_PHYSICIAN"></a>ASSISTANT PHYSICIAN.</h2>


<div class="hrsection"><hr /></div>
<h3>FIRST.</h3>

<p>&#8220;The Assistant Physician shall perform&#8221; the &#8220;duties,
and be subject to the responsibility of the Superintendent,
in his sickness or absence, and&#8221; he &#8220;may call to his
aid, for the time being, such medical assistance, as he
may deem necessary&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;and perform such other duties as
may be directed by the Superintendent and prescribed by
the By-Laws.&#8221;&mdash;[<i>State Law of 1858.</i></p>


<div class="hrsection"><hr /></div>
<h3>SECOND.</h3>

<p>He shall prepare and superintend the administration of
medicines, visit the wards frequently, and carefully note
the condition and progress of individual cases; see that the
directions of the Superintendent are faithfully executed,
and promptly report any case of neglect or abuse that may
come under his observation, or of which he may be informed.</p>


<div class="hrsection"><hr /></div>
<h3>THIRD.</h3>

<p>He shall assist in devising employment and recreation
for the patients, and endeavor in every way to promote
their comfort and recovery; keep such records of cases as
the Superintendent may direct, assist in preparing statistics,
and conducting correspondence, and he shall perform
such other duties of his office as properly belong thereto.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span><a name="GENERAL_RULES" id="GENERAL_RULES"></a>GENERAL RULES.</h2>

<div class="hrchapter"><hr /></div>


<p>1. Persons employed in the service of the Asylum will
learn that character, proper deportment, and faithfulness
to duty, will alone keep them in the situations in which
they are placed; and they should consider well, before entering
upon service, whether they are prepared to devote
all their time, talents, and efforts, in the discharge of the
duties assigned to them. The Institution will deal in strict
good faith with its employees, and it will expect, in return,
prompt, faithful, and self-denying service.</p>

<p>2. No one can justly take offense when respectfully
informed by the Superintendent, that his or her temperament
is better adapted to some other employment; and
those receiving such information should regard it as kindly
given, that they may have opportunity to avoid the unpleasantness
of being discharged.</p>

<p>3. Those employed at the Asylum be expected to
hold themselves in readiness for duty when directed by its
officers; and the neglect of any labor, or duty, on the
ground that laboring hours are over, or to hesitate, after
proper direction, on such pretexts, will be regarded as evidence
against the fitness of the employee for the place he
or she may hold.</p>

<p>4. It must be remembered by all the employees, that
their duties are peculiar and confidential, and that there is
an obvious impropriety in disclosing the names, peculiarities,
or acts of the inmates. It should never be forgotten
that the most cruel wounds may, by imprudent disclosures,
be inflicted on those whose conduct and language, during
their misfortune, should be covered with the veil of deepest
secrecy. Conversations, in relation to the Asylum and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>its inmates, sought by the idle and mischievous, should be
studiously avoided.</p>

<p>5. All persons employed in the Asylum are required
to cultivate a calm and deliberate method of performing
their daily duties&mdash;carelessness and precipitation being
never more out of place than in an insane asylum. Loud
talking, hurrying up and down stairs, rude forms of address
to one another, and unsightly styles of dress, are wholly
misplaced where everything should be strictly decorous
and orderly.</p>

<p>6. In the management of patients, unvarying kindness
must be strictly observed by all. When spoken to, mild,
pleasant and persuasive language must never give place to
authoritative expressions of any kind. All threats, taunts,
or other kinds of abuse in language, are expressly forbidden.
A blow, kick, or any other kind of physical abuse,
inflicted on a patient, will be immediately followed by the
dismissal of the person so offending.</p>

<p>7. Employees having charge of patients outside of the
wards, whether for labor or exercise, will be held responsible
for their safe return, unless, by the direction of an officer
they shall be transferred to the charge of some other
person; and when patients employed out of doors become
excited, they must be immediately returned to the wards
whence they were taken, and the fact reported at the office.</p>

<p>8. It will be expected of all employed in or about the
Asylum, to check, as far as possible, all conversations or
allusions, on the part of patients, to subjects of an obscene
or improper nature, and remove, when in their power, false
impressions on their minds, respecting their confinement
or management; and any person who shall discover a patient
devising plans for escape, suicide, or violence to others,
is enjoined to report it to an officer without delay.</p>

<p>9. The place of duty of those having charge of patients
is in the wards, or in the yards, or in the garden with the
patients. During the day and while the patients are out of
their sleeping apartments, they have no business in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>rooms, except for a momentary errand to adjust their
own clothing; and any employee who shall enter his or
her room, and engage in reading, writing, entertaining visitors,
or be otherwise off duty, will be acting in violation of
rule.</p>

<p>10. The employees are not permitted to correspond
with the friends of patients; and all letters or packages to,
or from, patients, must pass through the hands of the Superintendent
or Assistant Physician. All making of dresses,
working of embroidery, or any mechanism, for the use
of employees, is prohibited, unless by the special permission
of the Superintendent; and no employee of the Institution
shall ever make any bargain with any patient, or his
or her friends, or accept of any fee, reward or gratuity from
any patient, or his or her friends, without the Superintendent&#8217;s
consent.</p>

<p>11. Employees will not be permitted to leave the Asylum
without the consent of the Superintendent or Assistant
Physician, and, when allowed to leave, they will be expected
to return by 9 o&#8217;clock <small>P.&nbsp;M.</small>&mdash;unless expressly permitted
to remain out longer. Before leaving they must
hang up their keys in the place, in the office, provided for
that purpose. Non-residents will not be permitted to remain
in the Institution at night without the knowledge and
consent of the Superintendent or Assistant Physician.</p>

<p>12. No person will be employed in or about the Asylum
who is intemperate in habits, or who engages in gambling
or any other immoral or disreputable practice; and
as the patients are not allowed the use of tobacco, within
the Asylum, the employees are expected not to use it, in
any form, in their presence.</p>

<p>13. While employees are not prohibited from <i>occasionally</i>
visiting each other in their wards, it should never become
a habit, and the indulgence is only allowed in view
of the spirit of emulation, which may thus be encouraged
by sometimes inspecting each other&#8217;s sphere of duty. When
it is discovered that the permission is abused, or that visits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>are being spent in idle conversation, it will be held as a
violation of rule.</p>

<p>14. The two departments of the Institution&mdash;male and
female&mdash;must always be separate to its employees, and no
person, whose post of duty is exclusively in the one, shall
ever be permitted to enter the other, unless some express
or proper occasion shall demand it; and any one who shall
discover, and not disclose, or who shall in any way encourage,
an acquaintance between two patients, of opposite sex,
will be held highly culpable for such misdemeanor, and
will be forthwith dismissed from service.</p>

<p>15. No employee will be permitted to appropriate to
his or her use any article belonging to the Asylum, or purchased
for the use of the patients, however small or comparatively
valueless it may be. From the salary of the person
so offending, the cost of the article will be deducted,
and he or she dismissed from service.</p>


<div class="hrsection"><hr /></div>
<h3>STEWARD.</h3>

<p>1. The Steward shall have a general oversight of the
business of the farm, garden, grounds, fences and buildings;
he shall assist in maintaining the police regulations
of the Asylum, observe the deportment of those employed
in subordinate positions, see that they do their duty, and
report to the Superintendent any instance of neglect or
misconduct, that he may observe, or of which he may be
informed; he shall see to the opening and closing of the
house; that the employees rise and commence their duties
at the ringing of the bell, and return at proper season at
night; that the bell is rung promptly at such hours as may
be designated, from time to time, by the Superintendent.
He shall have a general care of the male patients, see that
they are kindly treated, that their clothes are taken care
of, that their food is properly cooked, served and distributed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>that the rooms, passages and other apartments are
kept clean and properly warmed and ventilated, and that
every thing pertaining to the Asylum property is kept in
order and in good repair.</p>

<p>2. The Steward shall receive and store all provisions,
fuel, clothing, etc. provided by contracts, and, also, all supplies
purchased under the direction of the Superintendent,
and he will be held responsible for the safe-keeping and
economical distribution of the same.</p>

<p>3. He shall keep just, accurate and methodical accounts
of all articles received, and all articles purchased by
him, together with all distributions of supplies to the several
departments of the Institution&mdash;each and every day&#8217;s
accounts exhibiting, in detail, the number, quantity weight
or measurement, as the nature of the case may be, of each
and every article received, and from whom, and distributed,
and to whom.</p>

<p>4. On the receipt of supplies, whether obtained under
contract, or purchased by order of the Superintendent,
the Steward shall require a bill or invoice of the same,
and if, upon a careful examination of the quality, quantity,
weight or measurement of the article or articles, they shall
be found to correspond with the item or items of the bill,
he shall enter the aggregate amount, with the date and
number of the invoice, in a book provided for that purpose,
after which he shall endorse the bill <i>correct</i>, and file it, together
with an abstract of his daily disbursements, in the
office of the Superintendent.</p>

<p>5. The Steward will be expected to devote his whole
time to the interests of the Institution, assist, in every way
in his power, to preserve order in the house, and faithfulness
among the employees, and see that all the rules and
regulations of the Asylum are fully observed.</p>


<div class="hrsection"><hr /></div>
<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>MATRON.</h3>

<p>1. The Matron shall have charge of the female department
of the Asylum. It will be expected of her to be with
the female patients, in all the wards, as much as possible;
see that they are kindly treated; that their food is properly
cooked, served and distributed; that their apartments are
kept clean and in good order, and properly warmed and
ventilated; that the female employees attend to their duties
in all respects, and report to the Superintendent any
departure, on their part, from the rules and regulations of
the Institution.</p>

<p>2. The bedding, table linen, napkins, and drapery
furniture, carpets, table covers, and all similar property
of the female department, as well as the clothing of
the female patients, shall be under her general care and
supervision. She shall direct the employment and amusements
of all the inmates of the female wards; in short, it
will be expected of her to look frequently and carefully
into every interest connected with her department; and
thus, by devoting her whole time to the Institution, aid in
every way in her power, in securing the comfort and recovery
of the patients, and the general welfare of the Asylum.</p>


<div class="hrsection"><hr /></div>
<h3>CLERK.</h3>

<p>1. It shall be the duty of the Clerk to keep a correct
account, in a book provided for that purpose, of all supplies
received by the Steward under contract, or purchased
by him under direction of the Superintendent. He shall
keep a careful account of all articles used and consumed in
the Asylum daily, and at the end of every month, he shall
make an exhibit of the receipts, expenditures, and disbursements&mdash;arranging
the different articles used under appropriate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>headings, that the actual cost and consumption of
each article, for each day, shall be correctly shown. He
shall keep the <span class="smcap">Asylum Account</span>, the <span class="smcap">Physicians&#8217; Dwelling
Account</span>, the <span class="smcap">Garden Account</span>, the <span class="smcap">Office Account</span>, the
<span class="smcap">Farm Account</span>, and the <span class="smcap">Improvement and Repairs Account</span>,
each separate and distinct from the other, and make out
separate and distinct monthly exhibits of each. He shall
also make out, in connection with the exhibits of the above
accounts, a table showing the combined total cost per day,
and the combined total cost per month, with an average
cost per day; and the average cost of each patient per day,
and the average cost of each patient per month, together
with any other items that may be of interest and utility to
the Asylum. He shall make out a table showing what bills
are to be paid on the last month&#8217;s expenditures, and, also,
a table exhibiting the Superintendent&#8217;s estimate for the expenditures
of the ensuing month.</p>

<p>2. It shall be the duty of the Clerk to keep a correct
account of the patients received&mdash;entering, at the time of
their admission, in a book provided for the purpose, a condensed
copy of each commitment, with the facts set forth in
the certificate of the examining physicians accompanying
the same. He shall also note, in the same connection, the
condition of the patient, as found by the Superintendent or
Assistant Physician, at the time of admission.</p>


<div class="hrsection"><hr /></div>
<h3>SUPERVISORS.</h3>

<p>1. The Supervisors shall have a general oversight of
the duties of the Attendants; they shall spend their time
chiefly in the wards, and they shall see that the rules prescribing
the duties of the Attendants, towards the patients,
are faithfully observed, that the patients are well treated,
and in all respects properly cared for; they shall, in an especial
manner, have the oversight of the sick, and see that
watchers are detailed for such as require it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>2. They shall have the care of the clothing of the patients,
and the bedding, table linen, towels, etc., of their
respective divisions. On the arrival of a patient at the Institution,
whatever clothing is brought shall be committed
immediately to the Supervisor of the division to which the
patient is sent. A clothing account shall be opened for
each patient, in a book provided for the purpose, in which
shall be entered every article brought to the Institution,
including what may be on the patient&#8217;s person, and, also,
whatever may afterwards be received or purchased for the
patient&#8217;s use.</p>

<p>3. Money, jewelry, or other valuables, shall be brought
to the office for safe keeping&mdash;except where their retention
by the patient is expressly permitted by the Superintendent
or Assistant Physician. On the discharge, or removal,
of a patient, the clothing in his or her possession, shall be
carefully compared with the clothing account of said patient,
that any losses may be discovered or accounted for.</p>

<p>4. The clothing belonging to the patients, in each division,
shall be deposited in a room, set apart for the purpose,
the key of which shall be in custody of the Supervisor,
and, at some particular hour of the day, the Supervisors
shall be in attendance in their respective clothing rooms,
to exchange, or supply, such clothing as the wants of patients
may require, and Attendants are enjoined, not to call
on the Supervisors, for that purpose, at any other times, if
avoidable. Clothing required for daily use, shall be kept
in the ward closets.</p>

<p>5. The Supervisors shall have charge of the sewing
rooms, and when any patient is in want of new clothing the
fact shall be reported to the Supervisors, who will receive
instructions from the Superintendent in regard to its supply.
No clothing shall be purchased out of the Asylum, if
it can be manufactured in the sewing rooms.</p>

<p>6. The Supervisors shall be careful that the clothing
of patients is adapted to the season, and especially to see
that patients are not suffered to go out, either for exercise
or labor, without a careful inspection of what is worn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>7. All articles belonging to patients, shall be legibly
marked, and the Supervisors are expected to see that the
clothing of each patient is devoted to his or her use, and to
the use of no other.</p>

<p>8. The Supervisors shall see that each patient is supplied
with a full change of under clothing once a week, and
that their outer clothing, and all bed clothing, is changed
as often as their strict cleanliness shall require.</p>


<div class="hrsection"><hr /></div>
<h3>ATTENDANTS.</h3>

<p>1. Those employed in the wards in the care of the patients,
as their Attendants, should remember that their first
duty is to treat them with unvarying kindness, respect and
attention. Feelings of mutual good will, can, with few exceptions,
be successfully cultivated between Attendants and
those under their immediate care, and doubts may be
justly entertained of an Attendant&#8217;s fitness, when these are
wanting.</p>

<p>2. The first effort on the part of an Attendant, on receiving
a patient, should be to win his or her confidence,
however insensible the patient may be to kindly advances.
Patients generally enter the wards with the thorough conviction
that evil is intended them, and the first show of
harshness or force, however slight, will confirm that impression,
while kind assurances, and manifestations of sympathy,
quickly disarm them of their false impressions, and
the first great step in the way of cure is begun. The Attendant
should regard the patient as an honored guest, who
comes, tarries for a short time, and goes on his way, to give
to the world a good or evil report of his entertainer.</p>

<p>3. When a patient manifests opposition to the will of
the Attendant, the point should never give rise to protracted
discussion, as opposition may be only increased thereby.
Patients will usually yield when mildly and kindly informed
that they are only asked to comply with a rule binding on
all, and that the request is not merely arbitrary. Whenever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>continued resistance is anticipated, it is better to yield
the point to the patient, if the request made is one of no
great importance, and report the case to the Superintendent
or Assistant Physician.</p>

<p>4. The muffs, sleeves, wristbands, or other means of
confinement, are never to be used unless by order of the
Superintendent or Assistant Physician; and the Attendant
shall never, under any circumstances, use greater force
than is sufficient to secure the patient, himself, or others,
from the efforts of his or her violence, and after the patient
is secured in his or her room, the Superintendent or Assistant
Physician shall be informed of what has occurred.</p>

<p>5. During the evening, after patients have retired,
one Attendant or Assistant, shall always be present in each
ward, to discover any disturbance, and administer to any
necessity that may arise, and no Attendant shall ever leave
the ward in which he or she is engaged, without informing
an Assistant of his or her intended absence. During
the day Attendants are expected to make the patients, and
the patient&#8217;s clothing, and sleeping apartments, the objects
of their most careful attention.</p>

<p>6. On rising in the morning, Attendants shall see that
the patients are properly dressed, washed, hair combed,
and otherwise in good condition to appear at breakfast.
The beds shall be made, rooms, halls, dining rooms, water
closets and stair-ways put in good order by 9 o&#8217;clock, from
April to September inclusively, and by 10 o&#8217;clock from October
to March inclusively. All soiled clothing, bedding,
etc., shall be taken from the building, at the earliest possible
hour, before the air of the wards becomes contaminated
thereby. A straw bed once soiled or wet, shall be immediately
emptied and the tick sent to the laundry. The
wards and stair-ways shall be washed and swept as often
as necessary to secure perfect cleanliness. Attendants will
be assisted by the patients in the discharge of these duties,
but are themselves alone responsible for their prompt and
faithful performance; when Attendants or Assistants are
engaged with their patients in any kind of outside labor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>they shall keep a correct account of the time of the patient
employed, and report the same at the office at the close of
every week.</p>

<p>7. Attendants, in this Institution, are considered the
companions, not &#8220;keepers,&#8221; of the patients, and, regarding
themselves as such, they shall strive to keep every one,
whose physical health will admit of it, engaged in some
kind of amusement or employment in labor, as designated,
from time to time, by the Superintendent, or Assistant
Physician. The cultivation of fruits and flowers, the use of
the library, reading room, gymnasium, bowling alleys, and
other means for mental, moral and physical training, should
be in every way encouraged.</p>

<p>8. The Attendants should see that the patients indulge
in no pernicious practices; those given to solitary habits
must receive special attention, and, as far as possible, induced
to participate in the pursuits and amusements of
others. Indolent patients should be led about the wards
and yards, and induced to join in exercises; those, on the
contrary, who are weak, and restless, should be induced to
take repose.</p>

<p>9. Attendants are forbidden to make walking out with
their patients a pretext for doing errands, or making calls
for themselves, and they must not go to town with the patients,
when the state of the roads and fields allow exercises
in other directions, and they must be especially vigilant
that patients, when out, do not obtain possession of any
dangerous implements, matches, or other articles improper
for them to have, and strict search must be made for such
immediately on their return to the Asylum, and before
they shall have time to secrete them in the wards.</p>

<p>10. On the morning of Wednesday and Saturday of
every week, each patient shall receive a tepid bath, unless
by reason of sickness or otherwise, exceptions shall be
made by the Superintendent, or Assistant Physician; the
male patients shall be shaven, and an inspection shall be
made that their hair and nails may be suitably trimmed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>and the person generally in cleanly condition. In trimming
the hair, no more should be taken off than necessary
to secure a better appearance of the patient&mdash;the practice,
of cutting the hair of the insane close to the head, being
positively forbidden, unless, for some special reason, it shall
be so ordered by the Superintendent or Assistant Physician.</p>

<p>11. On Mondays and Thursdays the Attendants shall
collect all clothing designed for the wash, and deliver the
same, with lists thereof, to the Supervisors, at the assorting
rooms, and on Wednesdays and Saturdays they will assist
the Overseers of the laundry to assort the clothing, and
place the articles of each ward to themselves for the inspection
of the Supervisors, who will compare them with the
washing lists and make their return thereon.</p>

allowance as the nature of the case may require, but all
waste, gluttony, or improper habits at the table shall be
mildly checked by the Attendants. They shall be allowed
time to take their meals at leisure&mdash;habits of eating differ,
and all (the old particularly) should have time to eat without
hurry.</p>

<p>4. Food that has been handled, or rendered unfit for
use, shall be sent back in a receptacle provided for the
purpose, but whatever is fit to be served in another form
shall be carefully laid aside for future consumption.</p>

<p>5. Some very plain food should be kept in the dining-room
closets, for the use of those whose meals may have
been interrupted, or for old persons, or for convalescent
patients, who sometimes require food oftener than under
ordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>6. Care must be taken that no patient carries away
from the table a knife, fork, spoon, or any article of
food, and, to be sure of this, the knives, forks and spoons

any lost article.</p>
